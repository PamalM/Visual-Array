# Visual_Arrays

Visual Array is a fun project I worked on that focused on the basics of the numpy library whilst, incorporating other core python libraries. The project's goal was to visualize a numpy array through a graphical tkinter window. This project is a great visualization tool for beginner programmers who wish to understand how arrays are structured, how python does its indexing and hopefully makes the array learning process much more easier for those struggling with understanding arrays. This project personally helped my younger brother understand how arrays worked. 

In addition, other libraries such as os, getpass, and platform were utilized to read/write to the user's machine. I've implemented a solution to allow the user to save the sorted/filtered arrays to their desktop on their local machines. This project also touches on the basics of file i/o. Finally, the tabulate library was utilized to apply typography to the console messages that were outputted in the terminal. 

Sample output for a 2 dimensional array:
